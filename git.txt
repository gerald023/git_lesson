to initialize the git file you type = git init
the (git add .) command add every file to the repository
(git add index.html) adds only the html file named index to the repository.
to check the files that have been added to the repository so far we use (git status).
to commit to the repository (git commit -m "added index page") the '-m' stands for message which is written in the quotation mark.
when you commit for the first time, the git asks who you are, meaning you have to provide your email and your username messages like this will be seen > 
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "your name"

to enter your email and username your do this >
git config --global user.email = "you@example.com"
git config --global user.name "your name" 

to know the branch we are on we do > (git branch) by default the git branch is named master 
but to change the git branch we do (git branch -M main) the name changes to main.

to link our project to github we do (git remote add origin https://github.com/gerald023/git_lesson.git). this links the project file to the repository named git_lesson.
to remve from the github we do (git remote remove origin)

PUSHING THE CODE ADDED AND COMMITED TO THE REPOSITORY 
(git push -u origin main)
